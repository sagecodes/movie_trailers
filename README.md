 #Movie Trailer Website
###This is the movie trailer website built as project #1 for the [Udacity fullstack devleoper course](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)

You'll need [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed before you can run the program.
Once you download the program files navigate to the directory in your terminal and run the entertainment.py file:
